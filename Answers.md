1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

    In client-side routing the server gives the client all the needed information for the page. In a server-side routing scenario the client requests a page and the server then gives the client that page and all the information needed. Client-side routing takes longer on initial load but the site itself then runs extremely quickly. Server-side routing is a faster initial load but much slower to traverse the site.
